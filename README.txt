This Connect4 implementation was developed and tested on an Ubuntu 16.04
host, using python 2.7.12.

python requirements are documented in the requirements.txt file and may be
installed with pip by running the following (with sudo, if required):
     pip install -r requirements.txt

Tests may then be run using nosetests (included in the requirements file)
by running the following in a directory where both c4board.py and
test_c4board.py reside:
     nosetests

Both c4board.py and test_c4board.py are verified to be pep8 compliant.
